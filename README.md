In the initial phase, Part 1 entails establishing the Virtual Machine within the Microsoft Azure framework, tailored specifically for our environment. This involves the straightforward task of crafting a machine with fundamental configurations, including specifications such as size, operating system, and network settings, all meticulously designed to suit the requirements of our lab environment.
